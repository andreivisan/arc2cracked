# Rust programming language

## 1. Variables

- By default variables are mutable. 
- Adding `mut` to a variable makes it mutable.

```rust
let mut x = 7;
```
- Constants are also immutable, but unlike vars they can't be made mutable. The
data type of constants MUST be annotated. 

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

- Constants expressions can be evaluated at compile time.

### Shadowing

- When declaring a new variable with the name of a previous variable, the second
variable overshadows the first, the Rust compiler will only use the second. That
is called `Shadowing`.

## 2. Data Types

### Scalar Types

- A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has 4 primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans and characters.

**Integer Types**

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit| i128   | u128     |
| arch   | isize  | usize    |
---

- Each signed variant can store numbers from –(2n – 1) to 2n – 1 inclusive,
where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers
from –(27) to 27 – 1, which equals –128 to 127.

- The isize and usize types depend on the architecture of
the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table
as “arch”: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a
32-bit architecture.

- Number literals can also use ```-``` asa visual separator to make the number 
easier to read, such as 1_000, whichwill have the same value as if you had 
specified 1000.

| Number literals | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Decimal        | 98_222  |
| Hex            | 0xff    |
| Octal          | 0o77    |
| Binary         | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only) | b'A'    |
