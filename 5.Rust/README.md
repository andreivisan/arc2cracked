# Rust programming language

## 1. Variables

- By default variables are mutable. 
- Adding `mut` to a variable makes it mutable.

```rust
let mut x = 7;
```
- Constants are also immutable, but unlike vars they can't be made mutable. The
data type of constants MUST be annotated. 

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

- Constants expressions can be evaluated at compile time.

### Shadowing

- When declaring a new variable with the name of a previous variable, the second
variable overshadows the first, the Rust compiler will only use the second. That
is called `Shadowing`.

## 2. Data Types

### Scalar Types

- A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has 4 primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans and characters.

**Integer Types**

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit| i128   | u128     |
| arch   | isize  | usize    |
