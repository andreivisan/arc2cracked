Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense front view (with camera connector). This tiny board will be our platform for learning Rust in embedded AI applications.

  

  

Introduction

  

  

Welcome to a comprehensive self-study course on Rust for Embedded Development using the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense – a thumb-sized board with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, an OV2640 camera, digital microphone, and 8MB PSRAM . This course is tailored for experienced developers (Java/Python) aiming to learn Rust for embedded systems. We will build up to an ambitious project: a wearable assistant that captures images and audio, transcribes speech via an AI service (like OpenAI Whisper), forwards the transcription to an AugmentOS AI agent, and then displays the AI’s response on Mentra Mach1 smart glasses over Bluetooth. Along the way, you will set up a robust Rust toolchain, learn embedded Rust fundamentals (memory safety, concurrency, HALs), interface with the ESP32S3’s camera and microphone, handle networking (Wi-Fi, HTTP/HTTPS, MQTT), integrate external APIs, and manage Bluetooth communication to output results. The focus is on teaching concepts and best practices – you’ll find code snippets and reference implementations, but not a full plug-and-play solution. This document is structured as a living reference with chapters and sections you can revisit as you progress.

  

How to Use this Course: Each chapter builds on the previous, combining theory with practical tips. Short code examples demonstrate key techniques, and references to documentation or books are provided for deeper insight. As a Rust newcomer, you should have basic Rust familiarity (through the Rust Book or similar) – but we’ll reinforce crucial concepts in an embedded context . By the end, you’ll know how to harness Rust’s power (like zero-cost abstractions and memory safety) on a resource-constrained device, and you’ll be prepared to tackle the final AI assistant project one piece at a time.

  

  

1. Development Environment Setup

  

  

To develop Rust firmware for the ESP32S3, a proper environment is essential. We will use both Cursor (an AI-powered code editor) and Neovim (a popular modal text editor) to write and navigate code. In this chapter, we’ll set up the Rust toolchain, ESP32-specific tools, and ensure our editors are configured for embedded development.

  

  

1.1 Installing Rust and Espressif Toolchain

  

  

Rust’s standard tooling (rustup, cargo) will be our foundation. The ESP32-S3’s CPU uses the Xtensa LX7 architecture , which requires some extra steps since it’s not a native Tier-1 Rust target. As of 2025, Rust supports ESP32 targets but they are still Tier-3 (meaning not pre-built in rustup) . The simplest approach is to use espup, Espressif’s installer for the Rust + ESP toolchain . Here’s how to get set up:

  

-   Install Rust – If not already installed, get the latest stable Rust toolchain via rustup (include the rust-src component for building core library). You may need nightly for certain unstable features (like build-std), but the ESP framework handles most of this now.
-   Install espup – Run cargo install espup then espup install to automatically install the Xtensa toolchain, GCC, and add Rust targets for ESP32. This ensures the xtensa-esp32s3-espidf target (for ESP32-S3 with ESP-IDF support) is added. Alternatively, manually add the target with rustup (if available) or use a custom toolchain as directed by Espressif. The target triple for the ESP32-S3 is xtensa-esp32s3-espidf (when using STD/ESP-IDF) .
-   ESP-IDF and tools – The Rust esp-idf-sys crate can automatically fetch the ESP-IDF C SDK and required cross-compilation tools on build. However, it’s often useful to pre-install ESP-IDF tools (like xtensa-esp32s3-elf GCC and esptool). Espressif’s official ESP-IDF installer or ESP-IDF VS Code Extension can set up the C toolchain if you prefer. In Rust, these will be invoked behind the scenes by build scripts.
-   Flashing utilities – Install espflash and cargo-espflash for flashing firmware to the board via USB . These tools wrap Espressif’s esptool functionality. For example, cargo espflash --target xtensa-esp32s3-espidf flash will build and upload the firmware in one step .
-   Monitor – You can use cargo espflash monitor (or espflash with the --monitor flag) to view serial output (logs) from the device. This is very useful for debugging, as we’ll see later.

  

  

After installing, verify everything by checking that rustc --version works and that rustup target list | grep esp32 shows the ESP32 targets. Also run cargo espflash --version to confirm the flash tool is available.

  

Setting Up a New Project: Espressif provides a project template for Rust. We highly recommend using cargo-generate with the official esp-idf-template. This will scaffold a new project with proper settings. For example:

cargo install cargo-generate ldproxy espflash cargo-espflash   # if not already installed

cargo generate --git https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template

During generation, you’ll be prompted for a project name, the MCU type (choose esp32s3 for our board), whether to use DevContainers, and whether to include STD support . Select “STD support: true” for this project (because we want to use the full ESP-IDF capabilities like Wi-Fi and networking). Also choose the ESP-IDF version (stable v4.4 or later). Once generation is done, you have a ready-to-build Rust project for the ESP32S3.

  

Inside the generated project, note a few things:

  

-   rust-toolchain.toml – This pins the Rust toolchain (often to a nightly) and the required components. The template might pin a specific nightly (e.g. nightly-2025-01-01) which is known to work . This ensures reproducible builds.
-   .cargo/config.toml – Contains cargo configuration. The template uses the espflash runner so cargo run will flash the board. It may also contain an [env] section where you can set ESP_IDF_TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR = "global" . Setting this to "global" is recommended to avoid each project downloading its own copy of ESP-IDF; instead a shared ~/.espressif directory will be used. Add this line if not already present.
-   Dependencies – The template’s Cargo.toml will include esp-idf-sys, and possibly esp-idf-hal and esp-idf-svc (we’ll explain these soon). It may also include embedded-svc (a crate for abstraction traits). Ensure these are present. If not, you should add the latest versions of esp-idf-hal and esp-idf-svc under [dependencies] (for example, esp-idf-hal = "0.45", esp-idf-svc = "0.51" – check crates.io for latest versions).

  

  

With the project generated and configured, try building and flashing the basic template to verify everything is working. From the project directory:

cargo run  # This should compile, flash, and open a monitor

On a successful run, you’ll see the firmware boot log and likely a “Hello, world!” printed from Rust . Congratulations – you have a working Rust-on-ESP environment! If cargo run is stuck on “Connecting…” when flashing, ensure your board is in the right boot mode (reset if necessary) and that no other process has the COM port open . Once flashed, you might need to reset the board to see the output if the program finished. (Tip: if your main returns immediately, the ESP32 will exit the program; usually we’ll run an infinite loop or sleep to keep it alive, since embedded programs don’t “exit” normally .)

  

  

1.2 Editor Configuration (Cursor & Neovim)

  

  

Having the right editor setup will greatly enhance your productivity. We’ll cover Neovim first, then Cursor:

  

-   Neovim: Ensure you have the Rust Analyzer LSP server installed (rustup component add rust-analyzer or use your OS package). In Neovim, a plugin like nvim-lspconfig can configure Rust Analyzer. Also install plugins for Rust features (such as rust.vim or rust-tools.nvim) for syntax highlighting, inlay hints, etc. It’s useful to have an LSP-aware autocomplete (via nvim-cmp or coc.nvim). For embedded, you may want a plugin or custom command to open a serial monitor. However, since we can use cargo espflash monitor in a separate terminal, you might simply split your terminal. You can map a Neovim command to build & flash (e.g., :make run if you set up the project with a Makefile, or use :TermExec to call cargo).
-   Cursor: Cursor is an AI-assisted editor, built on VSCode but with AI code understanding. For Rust, you should configure Cursor to use Rust Analyzer for accurate code navigation. There is a known extension “Cursor Rust Tools” which connects the Cursor AI to Rust Analyzer . Installing this will help the AI suggestions to be aware of Rust types and documentation. Make sure to open the project folder in Cursor so it can index the Cargo.toml and build context. With Cursor, you can use natural language commands to generate or modify code – but remember to verify the code with Rust’s compiler (the AI might not know all details of esp-idf APIs). Treat the AI as a helper for boilerplate, not ground truth.

  

  

General tips for either editor:

  

-   Auto-completion and Docs: Leverage Rust Analyzer’s auto-complete to discover functions (e.g., start typing wifi. to see available methods). Use hover tooltips to read documentation of ESP-IDF wrappers.
-   Formatting: Rustfmt integration will keep code tidy. Ensure it’s enabled (most setups format on save or via :Format command).
-   Error Checking: Rust Analyzer will underline errors; use :lnext/:lprev in Vim or the Problems panel in Cursor to jump through them.
-   Building/Flashing: You can run cargo build, cargo run, etc. from a terminal inside the editor. In VSCode/Cursor, consider setting up a task for cargo run so you can use a keystroke to flash. In Neovim, you might use the :make command or simply run :!cargo run.

  

  

By setting up a comfortable environment now, you’ll more easily iterate on code as we dive into the fun stuff.

  

  

2. Embedded Rust Fundamentals

  

  

Rust brings powerful guarantees and abstractions to embedded programming, but it’s important to understand how those apply in low-level development. In this chapter, we’ll review key Rust concepts (ownership, safety, concurrency) in the context of embedded systems. We’ll also highlight differences you’ll notice coming from Java/Python.

  

  

2.1 Rust’s Ownership and Memory Safety on Microcontrollers

  

  

One of Rust’s hallmark features is memory safety without garbage collection. This is especially valuable in embedded devices where resources are limited and reliability is critical. Unlike Python or Java which use garbage-collected heaps, Rust uses an ownership model (with compile-time checks) to ensure you never access freed memory or out-of-bounds data. The result is no null-pointer dereferences, no use-after-free, and no data races at runtime – all enforced by the compiler.

  

On an embedded microcontroller, where there’s no OS to catch you if you go wrong, Rust’s safety guarantees prevent many common bugs (buffer overruns, stray pointer writes) that could otherwise crash or corrupt the device. For example, if you attempt to use an uninitialized pointer or exceed an array boundary, the code simply won’t compile. In C or C++, such mistakes often lead to hard-to-debug issues. Rust essentially gives us C-like performance with much stronger correctness checks. This means we can write low-level drivers and manipulate hardware registers with confidence that once it compiles, certain classes of bugs are eliminated.

  

That said, Rust does allow unsafe code when needed (e.g. interfacing with raw hardware or foreign APIs). We’ll encounter unsafe blocks especially when calling ESP-IDF C functions or handling raw pointers (like camera frame buffers). It’s crucial to minimize and encapsulate unsafe code. When you must use it, do so in small sections that you can reason about, and justify why it’s safe (for instance, “I dereference this pointer but I know it’s valid because the camera driver provided it”). The rest of your Rust code can remain in the safe world.

  

Stack vs Heap: In embedded Rust, you’ll often favor stack allocation for determinism (stack memory is limited but avoids fragmentation). Rust’s ownership model naturally encourages using stack and value semantics. But thanks to the ESP32S3’s ample RAM and the fact we are using the STD environment with a heap, we can also allocate on the heap (e.g. use Vec, Box) when needed. Just be mindful: our device has 8MB PSRAM which is decent, but large allocations (like full images or audio buffers) should be done with care. We will leverage the heap for buffering camera images, but perhaps stream or chunk data to avoid using too much memory at once. We’ll discuss performance tuning later.

  

  

2.2 Concurrency and Real-Time Considerations

  

  

Rust’s model of concurrency (ownership + thread safety traits) offers a great advantage: fearless concurrency. In embedded systems, you often have to deal with concurrent tasks – sensor reading, communication, control loops – possibly in interrupt handlers or RTOS threads. Rust ensures that data shared across threads or interrupts is handled safely. For example, a mutable global variable in C could be accessed from both an interrupt and main code, leading to race conditions if not carefully protected. In Rust, you can enforce that such data is wrapped in atomic types or locks (Arc<Mutex<T>> or similar), and the compiler checks that you don’t accidentally share non-thread-safe data across contexts. The ESP32’s environment (when using ESP-IDF) actually has a full RTOS (FreeRTOS) under the hood, which means you can spawn threads (tasks) and use synchronization primitives like mutexes provided by the OS. Rust’s standard library can directly use these (e.g. std::thread::spawn will create a FreeRTOS task, and std::sync::Mutex is a critical-section mutex). This is a unique feature – many microcontroller targets use no_std and avoid threads, but Espressif’s Rust supports the standard library.

  

We will indeed use multi-threading for simplicity in some parts of our project (for example, capturing camera data on one thread while handling network on another). Rust makes this safe by requiring that any data shared between threads is thread-safe. The compiler’s rules (types must be Send to cross thread boundaries, Sync for shared references) will guide our design. If you need to share a buffer or a flag between an ISR (interrupt service routine) and main code, Rust again can help via core::sync::atomic types or by disabling interrupts in critical sections instead of relying on volatile variables.

  

One thing to keep in mind is that concurrency on microcontrollers can introduce timing issues. If you create too many threads or heavy threads, you could starve high-priority tasks or trigger the watchdog timer. For real-time tasks (like reading a sensor at exact intervals or toggling a camera clock), you might prefer using interrupts or hardware timers rather than threads, as they have more deterministic timing. We will discuss interrupts in the advanced sections (and the Ferrous training advanced workshop also dives into that ). In our project, the critical timing might be reading the microphone or camera frames at the right speed – the ESP-IDF drivers internally handle a lot of that, but if needed, you could use hardware I2S interrupts to fetch audio data efficiently.

  

Finally, Rust’s async could be considered for concurrency as well. There are embedded async runtimes (e.g. Embassy), but since we rely on ESP-IDF (which uses an RTOS), it’s common to stick to threads or the event loop provided. Note that esp-idf-hal is adding async support for some drivers . An alternative model (not covered deeply here) could be to run an async executor on the microcontroller to handle multiple tasks cooperatively without threads. This can save memory (no per-thread stack) and can be a good fit for IO-bound tasks like waiting for network or sensor data. If you’re interested, the Embassy project is worth looking at once you grasp the basics.

  

  

2.3 Embedded Constraints: 

no_std

 vs 

std

  

  

In embedded Rust, a key concept is #![no_std], which means you use Rust’s core library without the full standard library (no OS abstractions, no heap unless you bring an allocator). Many microcontroller projects are no_std by necessity, because there’s no operating system or enough resources for things like files, threads, or heap. However, our scenario with the ESP32S3 is special: Espressif’s platform supports the full standard library thanks to the ESP-IDF (which provides an OS layer). This is a huge boon – it means we can use Vec, HashMap, threads, and even network sockets as if we were on a normal system (with caveats of limited memory). The Ferrous Systems material notes that using the STD approach “allows the most possibilities on Espressif chips” and their course is based on that approach . We will follow the same approach for our project, since features like Wi-Fi and TLS are far easier with the ESP-IDF support.

  

Still, it’s valuable to understand no_std basics because under the hood, even with STD available, the embedded hardware access often uses no_std concepts. For example, direct register manipulation uses Peripheral Access Crates (PACs) generated by svd2rust, and hardware abstraction layers (HALs) build on those . These PACs and HALs are typically no_std and can be used whether or not you have an OS. In fact, the esp-idf-hal we will use is somewhat hybrid: it provides HAL traits but leverages the ESP-IDF drivers underneath (which do require the OS). There is also an esp-hal (notice no “idf” in name) crate which is a pure no_std HAL if you wanted to run without Espressif’s OS. That approach might be used for ESP32C3 in bare metal, but since our goals involve Wi-Fi and camera, we stick with esp-idf which implicitly uses std.

  

Summary: We are effectively writing a multi-threaded, std-enabled firmware for a microcontroller. This is quite powerful – but remember, not all embedded Rust projects look like this. We’re taking advantage of a high-end MCU with an RTOS. For learning purposes, though, this allows us to focus on features rather than fighting low-level details like writing a TCP/IP stack or camera driver from scratch. Where needed, we’ll still discuss low-level workings (and even write bits of drivers ourselves), but it’s all about choosing the right level of abstraction so we can complete our project.

  

  

3. ESP32S3 and Rust: Ecosystem and Hardware

  

  

Before jumping into grabbing images and sending network packets, we need to familiarize ourselves with the ESP32-S3 chip, the XIAO board specifics, and the Rust crates that support this hardware. This chapter covers the Espressif Rust ecosystem (ESP-IDF, HAL, etc.) and an overview of the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense board’s hardware features we’ll use.

  

  

3.1 Rust on ESP32: The ESP-IDF and 

esp-rs

 Crates

  

  

Espressif’s IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF) is the official SDK for programming ESP32 chips in C/C++. The Rust community, in collaboration with Espressif, has created bindings and abstractions to use ESP-IDF in Rust. The primary crates in this ecosystem (maintained under the esp-rs organization) are as follows:

  

-   esp-idf-sys: the sys crate with unsafe C bindings to the ESP-IDF SDK. This is generated by binding to ESP-IDF’s headers. It exposes thousands of functions and definitions (e.g., esp_idf_sys::esp_wifi_init, esp_idf_sys::gpio_set_level, etc.). You typically don’t use this directly in high-level code except for niche cases or missing abstractions, but it’s the foundation.
-   esp-idf-hal: the Hardware Abstraction Layer crate that provides a safe API for hardware access, implementing the generic embedded-hal traits for things like digital I/O, SPI, I2C, etc.. Importantly, esp-idf-hal covers a broad range: GPIO pins, ADC, PWM, I2C, I2S (for audio), UART, etc., all using the underlying ESP-IDF drivers . It lets you write idiomatic Rust code to control hardware. We will be using this for tasks like reading from the microphone interface (I2S), toggling pins (perhaps for camera reset, or built-in LED), etc.
-   esp-idf-svc: the Services crate offering high-level wrappers for ESP-IDF services. “Services” means Wi-Fi, networking stack, HTTP client/server, MQTT client, SPIFFS filesystem, etc. For example, EspWifi in esp-idf-svc helps manage the Wi-Fi driver and connectivity . EspHttpClient wraps ESP-IDF’s HTTP client library for easy use . Using these means you don’t have to directly call C functions to connect Wi-Fi or open sockets – you get Rust structs and traits to work with.
-   embedded-svc: not an ESP-specific crate, but it defines traits for embedded services (Wi-Fi, HTTP, MQTT, etc.). The esp-idf-svc types implement these traits. This separation allows for writing code against an abstract interface (like a generic Wi-Fi or MQTT client) that could be implemented by different stacks. We won’t delve deeply into trait definitions, but you’ll see types like embedded_svc::wifi::ClientConfiguration or embedded_svc::http::Client trait in use.
-   PACs and BSPs: For completeness, there are peripheral access crates for each chip (e.g., esp32s3 crate generated from the SVD) and potentially board support crates (BSPs). If we were doing bare-metal, we might use the esp32s3 PAC to twiddle camera interface registers directly. In our case, we rely on the IDF drivers and esp-idf-hal instead of direct PAC usage (except maybe for certain low-level control in advanced scenarios). Nonetheless, the training reference explains that PACs give low-level register access and HALs build on them . There isn’t a specific BSP crate for XIAO ESP32S3 (to configure camera/mic pins, for example), so we’ll manage those details ourselves using HAL/PAC as needed.

  

  

In summary, the layered approach is: high-level services (Wi-Fi, HTTP etc.) via esp-idf-svc on top of esp-idf-sys for network features, and esp-idf-hal (plus possibly PAC) for hardware control. This combination “allows the most possibilities” on the ESP32 , giving you both rich features and the ability to drop down to low-level if needed. All our examples will use these crates. Make sure your Cargo.toml includes them and that you choose compatible versions (often the esp-idf-svc and esp-idf-hal versions are correlated with a certain esp-idf-sys version and ESP-IDF release).

  

One more piece: Build process. When you build your project, esp-idf-sys may kick off a build of the ESP-IDF C libraries if not already done. This can take some time on first build as it downloads and compiles the ESP-IDF (unless you installed it globally and pointed the crate to it). The Ferrous training uses a global installation to save time, as mentioned before. Expect the first cargo build to be lengthy; subsequent ones will be incremental. Also, ensure internet access for the initial build because it might fetch the specific ESP-IDF version. After that, you can build offline.

  

  

3.2 The XIAO ESP32S3 Sense Board and Peripherals

  

  

The Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense is our hardware platform. Let’s break down the critical components relevant to our project and how we’ll use them in Rust:

  

-   ESP32-S3R8 Module: The core of the board, containing the ESP32-S3 chip with 8MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM . The dual-core Xtensa CPU can run up to 240MHz – plenty of horsepower for our tasks (image capture, audio processing, networking). The PSRAM (pseudo-static RAM) is especially useful for camera applications, as images can be large. We will ensure that camera frame buffers are placed in PSRAM (the ESP-IDF camera driver does this when PSRAM is available). As developers, we might not have to manage that manually, but it’s good to know that memory is there, because internal SRAM is much smaller (typically ~512KB). The module also provides the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios and the base IO pins.
-   Camera: An OV2640 2-megapixel camera sensor is attached via a detachable module (the board has a tiny B2B connector for it) . The OV2640 outputs an 8-bit parallel data stream (D0-D7) with VSYNC, HREF, PCLK signals, and uses an I2C (actually SCCB, a variant of I2C) control interface for configuration. The ESP32-S3 has a special camera interface (called I2S in camera mode or “DMA capture”) to receive this data. In C (ESP-IDF), there is a high-level camera driver component (esp32-camera) that configures the pins, allocates frame buffers (in PSRAM), configures the sensor registers (via I2C), and fills buffers via DMA. In Rust, there is no out-of-the-box high-level crate for the camera yet, but we can use the ESP-IDF camera component through esp-idf-sys. In fact, esp-idf-sys allows including extra ESP-IDF components like the camera by tweaking Cargo.toml . We will do this when we get to camera implementation: essentially, we’ll instruct esp-idf-sys to compile the esp32-camera component, then call functions like esp_camera_init() from Rust. This approach has been successfully used by community projects (with a few gotchas about data alignment as noted in some issues) . The camera can capture JPEG images or raw frames; OV2640 can do UXGA (1600x1200) at low frame rates, or lower resolutions faster. We’ll likely use a smaller resolution like  QVGA or VGA for speed and memory reasons, and because sending huge images over network is slow.
-   Microphone: The board has a PDM digital microphone (probably a MEMS mic) connected to the ESP32-S3’s I2S interface . “PDM” mics output a 1-bit high-frequency stream representing audio, which the I2S peripheral can sample and decimate into PCM audio data. The ESP-IDF provides an I2S driver that can be configured for PDM input. Using esp-idf-hal, we have an I2sDriver or similar that we can set up for the microphone. We’ll need to specify the pin for data and clock. Checking the board documentation for XIAO Sense: likely the mic data pin is on a certain GPIO and the I2S WS (word select) or clock is on another. (We might find that info in the Seeed Wiki pinout diagrams , or a schematic). For now, assume we know which pins (we’ll confirm or you can trace on the board). In Rust, we’ll open the I2S driver in receiver mode. The HAL supports I2S (as per docs: “supports almost all ESP-IDF drivers: … I2S …” ). We can use it to read PCM samples into a buffer. We might get, for example, 16-bit audio samples at 16 kHz or 8 kHz – that quality is enough for speech to feed to Whisper (you can always do client-side resampling or send raw). The code will look like opening I2sDriver::new(...) with a config specifying mode=Rx, sample rate, bit width, etc., then calling i2s.read(&mut buffer). We’ll see an example when we dive into audio.
-   Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: The ESP32-S3 provides Wi-Fi 4 (2.4GHz) and Bluetooth 5 (including BLE) . Our project will use Wi-Fi to send data to internet services (transcription, etc.) and Bluetooth (likely BLE) to send results to the glasses. The XIAO has an onboard antenna connector and U.FL antenna for wireless . Make sure you attach the antenna for reliable range (tiny boards often need an external antenna to get good signal). In Rust, Wi-Fi is managed by EspWifi (from esp-idf-svc) which we’ll use to connect to an access point. Bluetooth is a bit more complex as Rust doesn’t have a high-level wrapper in esp-idf-svc at this time. We will likely have to use esp-idf-sys for BLE, or even write some glue code. The ESP-IDF has two BLE options: NimBLE (an smaller BLE-only stack) and Bluedroid (the full Bluetooth stack). We can use NimBLE via the esp-nimble component. For simplicity, we may configure the project to use NimBLE and then use its API to create a GATT server. This might involve calling functions from esp_idf_sys or a potential esp_idf_ble crate if one exists. Since this is advanced and optional for the final deliverable, we will outline the approach rather than implement fully in this course. But suffice to say, the hardware supports BLE, and we can make the ESP32S3 act either as a Peripheral (e.g., advertising a service that the glasses or phone connects to) or as a Central (initiating connection to another device). We’ll discuss which role makes sense when we focus on the glasses communication.
-   Other hardware: The XIAO has a few LEDs (a user programmable LED, a charge status LED) and a reset and boot button. We can use the user LED (likely on a certain GPIO pin) for debugging or status (blink patterns to indicate certain states). The board also has an SD card slot (the Sense has it, but note the Plus variant differences ). If you had a need to buffer data or use local storage (maybe saving images or logs), you could use the SD card. The ESP-IDF has an SD card driver (SPI mode or SDMMC). We won’t focus on it here, but keep in mind it’s available and the esp-idf-svc crate might have wrappers for mounting FATFS on SD.
-   Power: It has a Li-Po battery charging circuit. If you use a battery, be mindful of power consumption. Wi-Fi and camera can draw substantial current (the camera especially when capturing). The board’s specs mention different power modes and consumption . We won’t get into low-power modes in this course, but it’s good to know that such modes exist (light sleep, deep sleep) if you plan to deploy this on battery in the future. For our development, we’ll run via USB power, which also provides the programming interface.

  

  

In short, the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense is a power-packed little board – we have all the hardware we need for a wearable AI assistant. The challenge is mostly on the software side: orchestrating everything in Rust. We now know what crates will help us (esp-idf-hal, esp-idf-svc, etc.) and what each hardware part requires (camera – special component, mic – I2S, Wi-Fi – easy with service, BLE – some work in sys). Let’s proceed to the meat of the course: using these capabilities one by one.

  

  

4. Interfacing with Camera and Microphone (Vision and Audio)

  

  

Capturing data from the real world is our first big milestone. In this chapter, we focus on the camera and microphone on the ESP32S3 and how to access them using Rust. This involves understanding the device drivers and possibly writing or integrating driver code.

  

  

4.1 Camera: Capturing Images in Rust

  

  

Working with the OV2640 camera in Rust requires tapping into the ESP-IDF’s camera driver, since writing a complete driver from scratch would be a huge task. The ESP-IDF provides the esp32-camera component (also used in Arduino and ESP32-CAM examples) which handles sensor init and image capture. Here’s how we can integrate and use it:

  

Include the Camera Component: In your project’s Cargo.toml, within [package.metadata.esp-idf-sys], add an entry to include the remote component. For example:

[package.metadata.esp-idf-sys]

extra_components = [

  { git = "https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera.git",  bindings_header = "bindings.h", bindings_module = "cam" }

]

This tells esp-idf-sys to pull the camera component from GitHub and compile it. The bindings_header = "bindings.h" means you should create a C header file in your project (src/bindings.h) that includes the camera’s headers you need bindings for (likely #include "esp_camera.h"). The bindings_module = "cam" will put the generated Rust bindings in the module esp_idf_sys::cam. After a cargo build, you’ll have functions like esp_idf_sys::cam::esp_camera_init available . (Note: In some versions, an alternative approach is to specify component_dirs if you have the component locally. The above uses the component manager via git. Use whichever method is recommended by current esp-idf-sys docs.)

  

Camera Initialization: Using the camera involves setting up a config struct and calling esp_camera_init. The config (camera_config_t) includes pin assignments for XCLK (camera clock), SIOD/XSCL (I2C for camera), Y9-Y0 pins (D0-D7 data lines, etc.), and frame buffer settings (resolution, buffer count, format). On the XIAO S3 Sense, many of these pins are fixed by the board design. We need the pin map (from board schematics or definitions). According to Seeed, the Sense’s camera connector uses certain pins for the data lines and signals. (For example, likely: D0 pin might be GPIO…, VSYNC on GPIO…, etc. This info might be in the wiki, but if not, one can find it in the Arduino variant or ask Seeed forums .) Let’s assume we have those (for illustration, not actual): e.g. XCLK on GPIO 40, SIOD on GPIO 14, SIOC on GPIO 15, Y2-Y9 on some range, VSYNC on 41, HREF on 42, PCLK on 43. (Please check official docs for exact values!).

  

We fill a camera_config_t in Rust. Since it’s a C struct, the easiest is to use the bindings, e.g.:

let camera_config = esp_idf_sys::cam::camera_config_t {

    ledc_channel: esp_idf_sys::cam::ledc_channel_t_LEDC_CHANNEL_0,

    ledc_timer: esp_idf_sys::cam::ledc_timer_t_LEDC_TIMER_0,

    pin_d0: 4, pin_d1: 5, /* ... etc ... all the pins ..., */

    pin_xclk: 40, pin_pclk: 43, pin_vsync: 41, pin_href: 42,

    pin_sscb_sda: 14, pin_sscb_scl: 15,

    pin_pwdn: -1, // if no powerdown pin,

    pin_reset: -1, // if no reset pin,

    xclk_freq_hz: 20_000_000,

    frame_size: esp_idf_sys::cam::framesize_t_FRAMESIZE_QVGA,

    pixel_format: esp_idf_sys::cam::pixformat_t_PIXFORMAT_JPEG, 

    fb_count: 2,

    ..Default::default()  // other fields like jpeg_quality, buffers in PSRAM etc.

};

This is pseudocode; the actual field names might differ slightly. The pixel format can be RGB or JPEG; OV2640 has a JPEG compression, which is handy to get smaller image data. We might use JPEG directly to send to the server (saves bandwidth). The frame size QVGA (320x240) or maybe CIF (400x296) or VGA (640x480) depending on need. Using JPEG means the camera module compresses the image, and we get a buffer of a few tens of KB typically. If we wanted to process image data on device (e.g. run ML), we’d pick RGB or YUV format, but we plan to send it out, so JPEG is fine.

  

After config, call:

let res = esp_idf_sys::cam::esp_camera_init(&camera_config);

if res != 0 {

    // handle error (res is esp_err_t, 0 is success)

    println!("Camera init failed: 0x{:X}", res);

}

If successful, the camera is ready. We can then capture by calling esp_idf_sys::cam::esp_camera_fb_get(), which returns a pointer to a frame buffer (camera_fb_t). The camera_fb_t structure contains a pointer to the pixel data and the length (and width/height info) . We must be careful here: as noted in an issue, in debug mode the pointer might not be aligned to what Rust expects for usize and can cause an alignment fault when dereferencing . The workaround is typically to compile in release mode (which disables the strict align checks) or to adjust the struct alignment. For our usage, we’ll mostly run in release because we need the speed. But be aware of this pitfall.

  

Using the frame data is then straightforward: it’s a raw buffer of bytes. We can, for example, send it in an HTTP POST. We should free the buffer when done (by calling esp_idf_sys::cam::esp_camera_fb_return(fb_ptr) once we’ve copied or sent the data). Actually, if we call esp_camera_fb_get(), it gives us a buffer that is allocated by the driver; we must return it or we’ll eventually run out of buffers (with fb_count=2, you must return one before getting a new frame). So a pattern might be:

let fb = esp_idf_sys::cam::esp_camera_fb_get();

if fb.is_null() {

    // handle no frame

}

let fb_ref = unsafe { &*fb };  // dereference pointer to get camera_fb_t

let data_ptr = fb_ref.buf;

let data_len = fb_ref.len;

let slice = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(data_ptr, data_len) };

// use `slice` (JPEG binary data) here, e.g., send over network

esp_idf_sys::cam::esp_camera_fb_return(fb);

That’s an outline of capturing one frame. You could wrap that in a safe Rust function. For instance, create a struct Camera with a method capture_jpeg() -> Result<&[u8], CameraError> that handles this. But careful: the lifetime of that slice is only until we return the buffer. If we want to keep the data after returning the buffer, we should copy it into a Rust-owned buffer (e.g. a Vec). Since Whisper or other services may want the raw image bytes, we might directly stream or send them without a long-term copy – depending on how we implement the HTTP send, it might accept a slice.

  

For continuous usage, one could allocate two buffers and alternate (but that’s essentially what the driver does internally with fb_count=2). It’s fine to just get and return frames each time.

  

Troubleshooting Camera: If you run into issues: ensure PSRAM is enabled (in menuconfig or by a menuconfig setting via cfg.toml if needed, as large frame buffers need PSRAM). Also, ensure the XCLK (external clock) is configured to a supported frequency (20 MHz is common for OV2640). If images come out blank or the init fails, double-check the pin assignments and that the camera module is properly connected. In hardware terms, sometimes these camera modules require a good stable 3.3V and enough current – the XIAO should handle it but battery vs USB power can matter.

  

  

4.2 Microphone: Recording Audio with I2S

  

  

The digital microphone on the board outputs PDM audio. To capture it, we configure the ESP32-S3’s I2S peripheral in PDM RX mode. The ESP-IDF I2S driver allows enabling a built-in PDM-to-PCM converter (the S3 has hardware for this). Alternatively, the mic might be wired in a stereo PDM config, but likely it’s mono.

  

Setup using esp-idf-hal: The HAL provides I2sDriver or similar. We will likely use I2sDriver::new(I2S_PORT_0, pins, config) to initialize. We need to specify: which I2S port (0 or 1 – ESP32S3 has two). The pins: one will be data-in (let’s call it DIN) connected to the mic’s data, and one for clock out (let’s call it BCLK) which drives the mic. Possibly also a left-right clock (LRCLK) if it was stereo, but PDM uses just one clock and one data line typically. Check the board: the spec mentions “1x IIS” which suggests it has one data, one word-select, one bit-clock. But PDM doesn’t use WS (word select); it uses a single clock (like 2-4 MHz) and the data is a high-frequency bitstream. The ESP32 I2S can be configured for PDM by using specific i2s_config_t settings (like mode PDM and enabling internal filter). esp-idf-hal might have a higher-level way, but if not, we might call esp_idf_sys::i2s_set_pdm_rx_tx_mode() as in C examples.

  

However, assuming the HAL supports it: we’d create an I2sPins struct specifying sck and sd pins (and leave WS none). For instance:

use esp_idf_hal::i2s::*;

let i2s_pins = I2sPins::<esp_idf_hal::gpio::AnyInput, esp_idf_hal::gpio::AnyOutput, _, _> {

    // depending on hal version, perhaps:

    data_in: Some(mic_data_pin),

    data_out: None,

    bclk: Some(clk_pin),

    ws: None   // no WS for PDM

};

let config = I2sConfig::philips_pcm_short(16000, I2sBitsPerSample::Bits16); 

// The above might not cover PDM. If HAL doesn’t support PDM natively, we use standard PCM and internal config for PDM.

let mut i2s = I2sDriver::new(peripherals.i2s0, i2s_pins, config)?;

Actually, since PDM isn’t standard I2S (Philips) format, the HAL might not have a dedicated builder. If so, we might call unsafe { i2s_set_pdm_rx_mode(i2s_port, high_freq, low_freq) } to configure how PDM filter works. The details can be gleaned from ESP-IDF docs – typically, you configure the PDM receive to output 16 kHz audio from a 128 kHz PDM input, etc.

  

For simplicity, let’s say we manage to configure it for 16kHz, 16-bit audio mono. Then usage is:

let mut audio_buf = [0i16; 16000]; // e.g. 1 second buffer

let bytes_read = i2s.read(&mut audio_buf)?;

This will fill the buffer with 16-bit PCM samples (range maybe -32768 to 32767). The read call will block until the buffer is filled (unless you use non-blocking mode). In a real-time scenario, you might want to read smaller chunks more frequently or use interrupts. But for our project, if we want to capture e.g. 5 seconds of audio to send to Whisper, we can do that in a separate thread or even sequentially (though doing it sequentially will stall everything else for 5 seconds; better to do concurrently or use shorter recordings). A thread dedicated to audio capture could continuously push data into a queue for sending.

  

Audio Data Handling: The Whisper API (if using OpenAI’s) expects an audio file (e.g. WAV or MP3) or raw bytes. We likely will capture raw PCM and then either send it as WAV (which is PCM with a header) or as is if the API accepts raw PCM. E.g., OpenAI Whisper’s HTTP API expects an audio file upload (like .wav or .m4a). We can compose a WAV header around our PCM data (this is easy: 44 bytes header with format info) and send that. Alternatively, we could compress to MP3 or Opus on-device for bandwidth, but that’s far beyond our scope (and too heavy). So PCM/WAV it is.

  

Synchronization: If capturing audio and video together (like “video”), note that our system likely doesn’t need strict A/V sync. We might capture an image occasionally and mostly focus on audio streaming for transcription. That simplifies things – we don’t need to start camera and mic at exact same time, etc.

  

  

4.3 Writing Drivers vs. Using HAL/SDK

  

  

This course wouldn’t be complete without touching on the process of writing your own driver for a peripheral. In our case, we largely use existing drivers (camera via ESP-IDF component, I2S via HAL, etc.). But you should understand what it looks like to interface with hardware registers directly in Rust, as it’s a valuable skill for embedded development when no high-level library exists.

  

For example, if the HAL didn’t support PDM microphone input, one could use the ESP32-S3 Technical Reference Manual and the PAC (peripheral access crate) to configure the I2S registers. That’s a complex endeavor, but possible. Similarly, controlling the camera could be done by directly manipulating the GPIOs and DMA, though leveraging the existing C code saves us time.

  

The Ferrous training’s advanced section covers writing an I2C sensor driver as an exercise . The process generally is: use the HAL’s I2C to communicate with the sensor (or use PAC to twiddle bits on I2C registers), construct safe Rust abstractions around that (like a struct Accelerometer with methods to read acceleration, etc.). The key is to keep any unsafe interactions isolated. In our project, if we hypothetically wrote a driver, say for a Bluetooth module (if one existed externally), we would define the register addresses, use PAC to modify bits, ensure correct ordering of operations (maybe with volatile or compiler fences if needed), and wrap it in a safe API.

  

For the OV2640 camera, writing a full driver from scratch in Rust would involve: configuring GPIO matrix for camera pins, I2C config to talk to OV2640 registers, enabling the DCMI (digital camera interface) or I2S in camera mode, setting up DMA descriptors, etc. That’s a huge task – which is why we wisely choose to reuse the esp32-camera component. But if you ever needed to interface a sensor for which there is C code available but not Rust, one pragmatic approach is what we did: compile the C code and call it from Rust (FFI). Another is port the logic into Rust (which might be straightforward for simple sensors, but for complex ones like a camera, it’s a lot).

  

Conclusion of this section: When possible, use existing safe abstractions (HAL or high-level drivers) to save time and reduce errors . But Rust gives you the tools to go low-level when necessary, either via unsafe FFI calls to C (as we did for camera) or by direct register manipulation using PACs. As an embedded Rustacean, you’re empowered to handle any level of the stack.

  

Next, we will move on to connectivity – getting the data off the device to the cloud services.

  

  

5. Connectivity: Wi-Fi and Networking in Rust

  

  

With the device capturing sensor data, the next step is to transmit that data to external services. This requires connecting the ESP32S3 to Wi-Fi, and then using network protocols (HTTP or MQTT) to communicate. In this chapter, we’ll cover how to connect to Wi-Fi using Rust and the ESP-IDF, how to perform HTTP requests (including HTTPS), and a brief mention of MQTT for IoT messaging. Networking is an area where Rust’s standard library and the ESP-IDF’s capabilities blend together through the esp-idf-svc crate.

  

  

5.1 Connecting to Wi-Fi (Station Mode)

  

  

To use any internet services, our device must join a Wi-Fi network (likely as a client to your router). The esp-idf-svc crate makes this relatively straightforward. The high-level steps are: initialize the Wi-Fi driver, configure it with SSID/password, start it, and wait for connection (DHCP). We will typically run Wi-Fi in its own background task (the ESP-IDF does that internally) and just check status or block until connected.

  

Using EspWifi (which implements embedded_svc::wifi::Wifi trait) :

  

Initialization: We need some context objects first. The Wi-Fi relies on the TCP/IP stack (LWIP) and event loop. In esp-idf-svc, these are provided by EspNetifStack (network interface) and EspSysLoopStack (system event loop), and also EspDefaultNvs (non-volatile storage for Wi-Fi calibration data, required by ESP-IDF Wi-Fi) . Usually, you create them as follows:

let netif_stack = EspNetifStack::new()?;     // network interface (provides ip)

let sys_loop_stack = EspSysLoopStack::new()?; // system events (handles wifi events)

let default_nvs = EspDefaultNvs::new()?;     // NVS storage for WiFi

If any fail, likely it’s because ESP-IDF initialization failed (check that you have NVS partition in partition table, etc., but the template usually sets that up).

  

Then create the wifi driver:

let mut wifi = EspWifi::new(netif_stack.clone(), sys_loop_stack.clone(), default_nvs.clone())?; 

Cloning those Arc-wrapped stacks is fine. The EspWifi struct now represents the Wi-Fi driver.

  

Configuration: Set Wi-Fi to client mode (station) and provide SSID/password.

use embedded_svc::wifi::*;

wifi.set_configuration(&Configuration::Client(ClientConfiguration {

    ssid: SSID.into(),

    password: PASSWORD.into(),

    auth_method: AuthMethod::WPA2Personal, // or WPA3, None for open

    ..Default::default()

}))?;

This call instructs the driver to become a station that will connect to the specified network . The ClientConfiguration can also set static IP if needed, but by default it will use DHCP.

  

Start and Connect:

wifi.start()?;

wifi.connect()?;

start() powers on the Wi-Fi (radio on). connect() begins the connection process to the AP with the config we set. This returns immediately, so we should wait for the connected status. We can poll wifi.get_status() in a loop, or better, use the event mechanism. Simpler approach: wifi.connect() actually internally waits for the connected event (I suspect it might not, but according to some examples, they check status manually). The example from earlier uses a while loop or pattern match to check connectivity :

use embedded_svc::wifi::Status;

if let Status(ClientStatus::Started(ClientConnectionStatus::Connected(ClientIpStatus::Done(_))), _) = wifi.get_status() {

    info!("WiFi connected");

} else {

    bail!("Unexpected Wifi status: {:?}", wifi.get_status());

}

This snippet checks if the status is “Started->Connected->Got IP” (Done) . If not, it errors out. In a real scenario, you might want to wait in a loop for a few seconds until that status is achieved, rather than error immediately. For brevity:

while !wifi.is_connected().unwrap_or(false) {

    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));

}

println!("Connected with IP: {:?}", wifi.sta_netif().get_ip_info());

sta_netif().get_ip_info() can retrieve the IP address assigned.

  

After this, the ESP32 is on the network! You can test by pinging from the device (there’s esp_idf_svc::ping if you want) or by trying an HTTP request.

  

Error handling: If the SSID is wrong or signal weak, you might not connect. The code above would loop for a long time. It’s good to implement a timeout or check for ClientConnectionStatus::Failed in the status to break out if unable to join. For our course, we assume you supply correct Wi-Fi credentials in a config file or directly in code.

  

Security note: Hard-coding Wi-Fi credentials in firmware is fine for dev, but in real products you’d want a provisioning method (like smartconfig, or a config portal) – out of scope for now.

  

  

5.2 HTTP Communication (Sending Data to a REST API)

  

  

With connectivity established, we can use HTTP to talk to cloud services. In our pipeline, we need to send the captured audio (and possibly images) to APIs: specifically a transcription API (OpenAI Whisper or similar), and then send the resulting text to AugmentOS or another AI service. This likely involves two HTTP interactions: one to upload audio and get text, and another to send text and get a response.

  

HTTP Client in Rust on ESP32: We have choices: use the ESP-IDF’s native HTTP client via esp-idf-svc, or use a Rust HTTP library. Because we are in STD context, one might think to use reqwest or ureq. However, those libraries might be heavy and not optimized for embedded (and could increase binary size significantly, plus reqwest pulls in a Tokio-like async runtime which might not play well). The recommended approach is to use the EspHttpClient wrapper. According to the training docs, esp_idf_svc::http::client::EspHttpConnection and the embedded_svc::http::Client trait are to be used .

  

A typical usage:

use esp_idf_svc::http::client::{EspHttpConnection, Configuration as HttpConfig};

use embedded_svc::http::client::Client;

  

// 1. Create a connection

let connection = EspHttpConnection::new(&HttpConfig::default())?;

// This default config uses the system’s LWIP and will handle both HTTP and (if enabled) HTTPS.

  

// 2. Wrap it in a Client trait object

let mut client = embedded_svc::http::client::Client::wrap(connection);

  

// 3. Prepare and send a request

let url = "http://example.com/data";

let request = client.get(url)?;  // for a POST, you’d use client.post(url)?

let response = request.submit()?; 

  

// 4. Check response

if response.status() == 200 {

    let body: Vec<u8> = response.bytes()?.collect(); // collects the body bytes

    println!("Response: {:?}", body);

} else {

    println!("HTTP request failed with status: {}", response.status());

}

This pseudo-code demonstrates a GET request. For a POST with data, you would likely do:

let mut request = client.post(url)?;

request.write_all(&my_data_bytes)?;

let response = request.submit()?;

The embedded_svc::http::client::Request implements Write for sending the body , and you call submit() when done writing. You can also set headers if needed by calling methods on the request before sending (for example, request.set_header("Content-Type", "application/json")? or similar if provided by the trait).

  

For HTTPS: if your URL is “https://…”, by default the EspHttpConnection will handle it if you configured TLS. The ESP-IDF HTTP client will use mbedTLS under the hood. The Configuration can allow invalid certificates or you can embed a root CA. Often, for simplicity, you may choose to disable certificate verification (setting the config’s skip_cert_common_name_check or providing use_global_ca_store: true with the appropriate store). For calling known APIs (OpenAI, etc.), you should include their CA root in the firmware or use the default system trust (which IDF might have). The training likely covered upgrading to HTTPS by adding the server’s certificate or telling it to ignore (maybe the exercise used a site with a known CA). In production, proper certificate handling is needed for security. For now, assume we configure it to trust all (for development) or we embed the PEM of the CA for OpenAI etc.

  

Sending Binary Data (Images/Audio): When sending the audio file to Whisper API, we’ll likely use a multipart/form-data POST (since OpenAI’s Whisper API expects a file upload along with form fields). That means we have to construct a multipart request: set content-type to multipart with boundary, then the body has the proper format (headers and file content). We could either craft that manually or use a crate. There’s multipart crate but that may be heavy. Since this is an educational context, we might do it manually: e.g.,

let boundary = "----BOUNDARY123";

let mut request = client.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions")?;

request.set_header("Authorization", format!("Bearer {}", OPENAI_API_KEY))?;

request.set_header("Content-Type", format!("multipart/form-data; boundary={}", boundary))?;

// Write multipart body

write!(request, "--{}\r\n", boundary)?;

write!(request, "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"audio.wav\"\r\n")?;

write!(request, "Content-Type: audio/wav\r\n\r\n")?;

// Write binary audio data:

request.write_all(&wav_bytes)?;

write!(request, "\r\n--{}--\r\n", boundary)?;

let response = request.submit()?;

Handling the response (which likely is JSON text with the transcription) can be done by reading response.reader() or response.bytes() and then parsing JSON (either manually or with serde if included). Given memory constraints, it might be easier to use a small JSON parser or even find the needed field via string search if we know the format (OpenAI returns JSON with a “text” field).

  

Note: The above code glosses over error handling for brevity. In practice, check each ? or use proper error propagation.

  

HTTP Server (Optional): The training covers writing a simple HTTP server on the ESP . We likely don’t need an HTTP server for our project, because the device is the client sending data out. However, you might create a small server for debugging (like an internal webpage showing status or a snapshot from camera). If interested, esp-idf-svc provides EspHttpServer for that. It can register handlers for endpoints. But we’ll not dive into it deeply here.

  

  

5.3 MQTT for IoT (Optional Messaging)

  

  

MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol often used in IoT for its lightweight overhead. AugmentOS or other systems might use MQTT to receive data from devices, or we could use it for sending the transcription or commands. If, for example, AugmentOS had an MQTT broker, we could have the XIAO publish the transcribed text to a topic, and the glasses (or phone) subscribe to that. Or vice versa.

  

Setting up MQTT in Rust on ESP32 is also facilitated by esp-idf-svc which has an EspMqttClient that implements embedded_svc::mqtt::client::Client . You’d configure it with the broker URL, client ID, credentials, etc., then use client.subscribe() and client.publish(). The training’s introductory course includes an MQTT exercise (publishing sensor data and receiving commands) . The code might look like:

let mqtt_config = MqttClientConfiguration {

    client_id: Some("xiao-esp32s3"),

    protocol: ProtocolVersion::V3_1_1,

    ..Default::default()

};

let (mut mqtt_client, mut connection) = EspMqttClient::new(broker_url, &mqtt_config)?;

mqtt_client.subscribe("augmented/commands", QoS::AtMostOnce)?;

mqtt_client.publish("augmented/transcriptions", QoS::AtLeastOnce, false, b"Hello from Rust!")?;

And then you’d have to handle incoming messages by reading from connection (which could be an iterator of messages). Given our focus, MQTT is optional. If AugmentOS has a REST API (likely, since they mention a cloud SDK with TypeScript), we might stick to HTTP.

  

Nonetheless, it’s good to know that for IoT projects, MQTT is available and often a great way to decouple devices from services.

  

Networking Performance: The ESP32S3 can handle decent data rates (it’s Wi-Fi 4, 2.4GHz). Uploading a few hundred KB audio or image should be fine (just keep an eye on memory – streaming directly from camera to network or from I2S to network without huge buffers is ideal). The esp-idf-svc client likely buffers as needed. Use chunked transfer encoding for large data if possible to avoid needing content-length upfront (the HTTP client might do this by default for us when we stream via write_all without setting length).

  

We should also be careful to not starve other tasks during network IO – but since networking is mostly waiting on data, the RTOS will schedule other tasks. If using blocking calls (like our synchronous client), other FreeRTOS tasks (including Wi-Fi driver) still run. It’s preemptive multitasking.

  

At this point, our device can capture data and send it off to be processed by AI services. Next, we handle the final leg: receiving the AI’s response and conveying it to the user via the smart glasses.

  

  

6. Integrating External AI Services

  

  

Our project involves two main external AI services: a transcription service (like OpenAI Whisper API) and AugmentOS AI for processing the transcription and generating a result. In practice, you might have one service that does both (for example, AugmentOS might provide an API that accepts audio and returns a response). But for educational purposes, we treat them separately. In this chapter, we outline how to interface with these services from our device.

  

  

6.1 Transcription via Whisper API

  

  

OpenAI Whisper is a powerful speech-to-text model. OpenAI provides a cloud API for it (as part of their suite) where you send audio and get back text. We already sketched the HTTP request in section 5.2. Let’s flesh it out:

  

To call the Whisper transcription endpoint (POST /v1/audio/transcriptions), you need: the audio file, the model name (e.g. "whisper-1"), and optionally some parameters (like language, prompt). The response will be JSON containing the transcribed text.

  

Using our captured audio (let’s say we captured a 15-second WAV audio in English):

  

-   Prepare the audio data: If we have raw PCM, convert to WAV by prefixing a proper header. The header format: 44 bytes including “RIFF” marker, file size, “WAVE” marker, “fmt “ chunk, and “data” chunk header with size. This is straightforward to write (plenty of references if needed). Alternatively, we could capture directly to WAV if we included the header before recording and updated sizes after (less convenient). For now, assume we have a Vec<u8> wav_data.
-   HTTP Request to Whisper: As coded earlier, we do a multipart form. We must also send a field for model. The API expects a field model=whisper-1 in the form-data, and the file field name “file”. So our multipart would have another part:

  

write!(request, "--{}\r\n", boundary)?;

write!(request, "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"model\"\r\n\r\n")?;

write!(request, "whisper-1\r\n")?;

in addition to the file part. After sending, we parse the JSON.

  

We should include the OpenAI API key in the Authorization header. Never hardcode secrets in published code; but in a device, it’s somewhat unavoidable unless you have secure storage. NVS can store the key, or you flash it as part of config.

  

Rate considerations: The audio length and API latency matter. Transcribing 15 seconds of audio might take a couple seconds on the API. That’s fine for our use (we’re not doing streaming transcription in real-time, presumably). If needing near-real-time, one might chunk audio and use a streaming API (Whisper doesn’t have streaming yet, but there are ways around it with shorter chunks).

  

Local vs Cloud: An alternative is running Whisper on-device – absolutely not feasible on an ESP32; the model is far too large and requires lots of compute. So cloud is the way.

  

Once we get the transcription text (say, "turn on the light" as an example of what user said), we then forward it to AugmentOS AI.

  

  

6.2 Sending the Transcription to AugmentOS AI

  

  

AugmentOS appears to be a platform for smart glasses apps. Likely, it provides an API endpoint (maybe a REST API or WebSocket or MQTT) where you can send text and an agent responds with some info or action. Without specific AugmentOS developer docs at hand, we can hypothesize a couple of approaches:

  

-   Cloud API: AugmentOS might have an HTTP endpoint where you send text (perhaps along with context or agent name) and it returns a response text. This would be akin to calling an AI assistant in the cloud (like ChatGPT API). If so, our device could do an HTTP POST with JSON: {"text": "transcription text", "user": "someid"} and get back {"response": "some reply"}. Implementing that is straightforward with the HTTP client, similar to how we’d call any REST API.
-   MQTT or WebSocket: Alternatively, AugmentOS might expect devices to connect to a message broker. For instance, the glasses might subscribe to a topic and our device publishes there. Or a direct BLE connection (which we’ll discuss in the next section).

  

  

Given AugmentOS markets a “cloud SDK” with presumably mobile integration, a simple way for us is to assume an internet API. Let’s imagine AugmentOS has an endpoint like POST https://api.augmentos.org/agent which takes a JSON body with the transcription and returns a JSON with the response to display. We would do:

let request_json = format!(r#"{{"transcript": "{}"}}"#, transcribed_text);

let mut req = client.post(AUGMENTOS_API_URL)?;

req.set_header("Content-Type", "application/json")?;

req.write_all(request_json.as_bytes())?;

let resp = req.submit()?;

if resp.status() == 200 {

    let mut resp_body = Vec::new();

    resp.reader().read_to_end(&mut resp_body)?;

    // parse resp_body (JSON) to get the response text

    let response_text = parse_json_for_field(&resp_body, "response")?;

    println!("AI response: {}", response_text);

}

This is pseudo-code. We’d use a proper JSON parser if possible (maybe a lightweight one to avoid heavy dependencies).

  

One could incorporate the transcription step and AugmentOS step into one by having AugmentOS handle speech input directly (for example, if AugmentOS offered an API to send audio and get text and action). But splitting it is fine for clarity.

  

Edge cases: Possibly the AI might return a long answer. If it’s just text to display, we’ll handle it. If it included something like a command (e.g., telling glasses to do something), that might require further handling. But likely it’s text for now.

  

  

6.3 Processing Responses and Device Actions

  

  

The output from the AI might be something to display (like a subtitle or answer to a question). Our main task is to send it to the glasses. But, consider if the AI’s response required the device to do something else (e.g., user says “take a photo”, AI might respond with “Photo taken!”). In such a case, the device should also act (take a photo) rather than just forward text.

  

In designing the system, you might incorporate a simple command recognition: if the transcribed text corresponds to a known command that the device itself should handle (like capturing an image or starting recording), you could intercept that before sending to AugmentOS. Or AugmentOS’s agent could decide and instruct the device accordingly (if there’s a return channel). For example, AugmentOS might reply with {"response": "Sure, here is the photo", "action": "capture_image"} meaning the glasses should display “Sure, here is the photo” and instruct the device to capture and maybe send an image. Handling such interactive flows would require a loop of communication, possibly with the device listening for a follow-up command. That goes into more complex territory – but it’s good to be aware how one might structure it (likely via MQTT or BLE characteristics if doing multi-step interactive tasks).

  

For our course, we assume a simpler model: user speaks a query, it’s transcribed and sent, AI returns an answer text, we display it. End.

  

Now, on to actually displaying it via Bluetooth.

  

  

7. Output to Mentra Mach1 Glasses over Bluetooth

  

  

The final step is delivering the AI’s output to the user through the Mentra Mach1 smart glasses. These glasses, as noted, have a display but no camera/mic – essentially an output peripheral. They fully support AugmentOS SDK , which likely means they are paired with a smartphone running AugmentOS that manages the content.

  

We have two possible routes to get data onto the glasses:

  

1.  Via the AugmentOS Cloud: If our device’s output goes to AugmentOS’s service, and the glasses are connected to that service via the phone, then simply providing the text to AugmentOS might result in it being pushed to the glasses (for example, through the AugmentOS app). In that case, our device doesn’t need to directly connect to the glasses at all; it just needs to ensure the data is sent to AugmentOS with the correct context (like a specific user or session ID so AugmentOS knows which glasses to send to). This would all be handled by AugmentOS’s infrastructure. This is likely scenario if the glasses are meant to be relatively dumb display devices controlled by the phone. If this is how it works, we already did the needed work by sending to AugmentOS in section 6.2, and the glasses will get it through their normal channels.
2.  Direct Bluetooth Communication: Perhaps the glasses can also receive data from a BLE peripheral (like our device) directly, especially if not going through internet. The Mach1 glasses support Bluetooth 5 (maybe BLE only). If we wanted to bypass the phone entirely and send directly from the XIAO to the glasses, we’d have to pair the XIAO with the glasses and implement a GATT service or use a standard BLE profile to send text. This is more complex and likely not the primary intended method (because the glasses presumably expect an AugmentOS app to feed them). However, it’s a great exercise in BLE so we’ll outline it.

  

  

  

7.1 Bluetooth Basics on ESP32

  

  

The ESP32-S3’s Bluetooth can operate in BLE mode (Bluetooth Low Energy) or classic (for example SPP profile). Most newer devices like smart glasses will use BLE. BLE doesn’t do simple serial ports without a specific service; instead, you have GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) where one device (peripheral) exposes services and characteristics, and another device (central) reads/writes or subscribes to them. To send a piece of text, an approach is to define a custom GATT service, with a characteristic for “AI Response”. Our XIAO, if acting as peripheral, could advertise a service like UUID 1234... and the glasses (if acting as central) could connect and read notifications from that characteristic. Alternatively, the XIAO could act as central and connect to the glasses if the glasses advertise something – but likely the glasses expect to be a peripheral to the phone (like many BLE accessories). Actually, wait, glasses might be central? It’s not obvious. If the glasses rely on the phone app, the phone is likely central and glasses peripheral. If we try to also connect as central to glasses, you can’t have two centrals simultaneously controlling a peripheral easily (unless the glasses support multiple connections). Unlikely.

  

So more likely, the glasses are BLE peripheral devices that the phone (central) connects to. If that’s the case, our XIAO cannot also directly connect to them unless the phone relinquishes or AugmentOS provides some relay mechanism.

  

Therefore, realistically, the data path likely goes through AugmentOS cloud/app, not a direct BLE link from XIAO to glasses. We should lean on that architecture because it’s simpler and matches how the product is described (glasses require the AugmentOS on phone to do anything). Thus, as soon as we did the AugmentOS API call, presumably the phone got the message and displays it.

  

However, since the user specifically mentioned Bluetooth to Mentra glasses, let’s assume maybe a scenario where phone is not in the loop (imagine offline mode: XIAO captures speech and directly beams to glasses). In that case:

  

Implementing BLE GATT on XIAO:

  

-   Use NimBLE (the BLE stack integrated). We set up as a GATT Server with a Service (say “NotifyService”) and a Characteristic (“TextOut”).
-   The glasses would have to act as BLE Client (central) to connect and subscribe to that characteristic’s notifications. If Mentra glasses are open, perhaps they allow connecting to custom BLE devices for data. (This would be outside AugmentOS though, unless AugmentOS has a generic BLE intake feature.)

  

  

Using esp-idf-sys for NimBLE: You’d call nimble_port_init(), configure a device name, create services, characteristics with ble_gatt_svc_def. This is somewhat low-level and C-like. There might be a wrapper in esp-idf-svc or embedded-svc for BLE, but not sure. Possibly not yet, as BLE is more involved.

  

Pseudo-steps:

// Pseudocode in C style (conceptual, not actual code)

ble_hs_cfg.gatts_register_cb = gatt_register_cb;

ble_svc_gap_device_name_set("XIAO-ESP32S3");

const ble_gatt_svc_def service_defs[] = {

  {

    .type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY,

    .uuid = BLE_UUID16_DECLARE(0xFFF0),  // custom service UUID

    .characteristics = (struct ble_gatt_chr_def[]) { {

         .uuid = BLE_UUID16_DECLARE(0xFFF1),

         .access_cb = text_access_cb,

         .flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_NOTIFY,

      }, {

         0, // no more characteristics

      } }

  },

  { 0 }  // no more services

};

nimble_port_freertos_init(...);

Then the text_access_cb might handle read requests (not needed if only notify). To send a notification with text, you would call something like:

ble_gattc_notify(conn_handle, attr_handle, data, len);

In Rust, we’d call the equivalent via FFI or if a wrapper exists.

  

We likely also need pairing if data needs to be shown on glasses (maybe not if it’s just open).

  

Anyway, once configured, the glasses (if in scanning mode) could find “XIAO-ESP32S3”, connect, then the XIAO on successful connection can send the latest AI response as a BLE notification. The glasses firmware (AugmentOS) would need to know to look at this characteristic and display whatever text it receives. If we were developing both sides, we’d define the protocol (maybe very simple: just plain UTF-8 text in notifications).

  

Given the complexity, in a real scenario, we might avoid reinventing the wheel and just rely on AugmentOS’s standard method (which likely uses the phone).

  

  

7.2 Using the Glasses via AugmentOS

  

  

To ensure completeness: AugmentOS likely provides an SDK where you can push notifications or text to the glasses through their system (the glasses connect to the phone, phone app connects to AugmentOS cloud). Possibly, instead of us sending to an AugmentOS AI, we could send to an AugmentOS “app” that we wrote, and that app would then output to the glasses. However, that requires writing an AugmentOS app in TS and is outside our device’s domain.

  

So focusing on the device: we might consider our job done once we send the data to AugmentOS’s cloud. The AugmentOS infra will handle showing it. However, the user explicitly listed “Displays the AI output on Mentra Mach1 glasses (Bluetooth-based)” as a goal, implying they expect the course to cover sending over Bluetooth specifically.

  

So, it might be wise to cover a simple case: use Bluetooth Classic SPP (serial port profile) as an alternative. If the glasses could accept a Bluetooth serial stream (maybe not, but just hypothetically), ESP32 can act as a BT Classic serial device. Classic BT is not as straightforward in Rust because NimBLE is BLE only, and Bluedroid (the older stack) covers classic. That might be too deep to cover here.

  

Given time, we’ll emphasize that typically the integration is via AugmentOS. If a direct BLE solution is needed for a custom use, it is possible but requires custom code on both ends (which might be beyond a Rust beginner project).

  

  

7.3 Performance and User Experience

  

  

When sending the output to the glasses, consider the latency: from speech to text to AI to glasses likely a few seconds. That’s expected. We should provide some feedback to user in meantime (maybe an LED blink while processing). Also ensure that if the user speaks again during processing, either you queue it or ignore it until done – out of scope but something to think about.

  

In terms of throughput, the text is small (couple hundred bytes maybe), so Bluetooth or cloud is fine.

  

Power: Keeping Wi-Fi and BLE on together increases power usage. If on battery, the XIAO could drain quickly (Wi-Fi ~100mA when active ). If wearable, consider duty cycling (maybe turn Wi-Fi off until needed, etc.). But if always listening for trigger word, you might keep mic on, which is another current draw. For our demonstration, we assume USB power or short usage durations.

  

To debug the Bluetooth communication, you might use a smartphone app (nRF Connect) to simulate the glasses by connecting to the XIAO’s BLE and see the notifications.

  

Alright, now we’ve covered capturing input, sending to services, and output to user. Let’s move to the final part: wrapping this knowledge into a cohesive project structure and some tips for debugging and improvement.

  

  

8. Performance Optimization and Debugging Tips

  

  

Embedded development can be challenging when things go wrong. In this chapter, we provide guidance on debugging, testing, and optimizing your Rust embedded application.

  

  

8.1 Debugging Techniques

  

  

-   Logging: The simplest way to see what’s happening is to use serial logging. The esp-idf-svc offers EspLogger which integrates with Rust’s log crate macros. You can initialize it at the start: EspLogger::initialize_default(); then use info!(), error!(), debug!() macros in your code . These messages will appear on the serial output (which cargo espflash monitor shows). For example, log when Wi-Fi connects, when data is captured, lengths of data, etc. This is invaluable to trace the flow. The ESP-IDF also produces logs (you’ll see Wi-Fi stack logs). You can adjust log levels in menuconfig (for less verbosity or more).
-   GDB Stub: The ESP-IDF has an option to enable an on-chip GDB stub that allows you to debug via serial (slower) or using a JTAG debugger. If you have a JTAG adapter, you can step through Rust code like normal (with some setup). This might be advanced, but it’s possible. For many issues, though, good logging suffices.
-   Unit Tests: You can write and run Rust unit tests for logic that is platform-agnostic (not needing hardware) on your host machine. For example, if you have a function that parses JSON from the AI, test it on your PC with cargo test to ensure it handles various cases. Obviously, you can’t easily test the HAL calls on PC, but you can structure code to isolate those (maybe have traits for “NetworkClient” or such and mock them in tests).
-   Hardware Troubleshooting: If camera isn’t working, test it with simpler code or the Arduino framework to ensure hardware is fine. If Wi-Fi won’t connect, check that region, channel, credentials are OK (maybe try connecting using an example IDF project to isolate issue).
-   Troubleshoot Memory: Use heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_DEFAULT) from esp_idf_sys to print free heap if you suspect memory issues. If you get panics, the backtrace might not be symbolic unless you have backtrace support (there is esp-idf-sys feature for panic backtrace). If your program aborts due to an assert in IDF, the log will show file/line of C code - sometimes indicates config issues (like “wifi init failed”).

  

  

  

8.2 Performance and Optimization

  

  

-   Release Build: Always perform time-sensitive operations (like capturing and processing) in --release mode. Rust debug builds are slow and can cause issues (like the camera alignment problem) . Release builds optimize code to be much faster (just be cautious that some checks are disabled). For development, you can do mixed: flash in debug for initial bring-up, but measure performance in release.
-   Memory Usage: Keep an eye on stack sizes of threads. The std::thread::spawn likely uses a default stack size (maybe 4KB or 8KB). For heavy tasks (camera), that might not be enough if done on a separate thread (the camera driver might allocate large buffers on stack? not sure). You can set a custom stack size with thread builder if needed. The main task’s stack in ESP-IDF default is also limited; if you overflow it, weird crashes occur. If so, increase CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE in menuconfig or create tasks with larger stack.
-   Buffering Strategy: For audio streaming, consider chunking the audio and sending it in pieces instead of one giant request to reduce RAM usage. For example, if Whisper allowed streaming (currently not sure), you’d send partial audio as you record. Right now, we take the hit of storing the full audio then sending.
-   Parallelism: Use the dual-core wisely. You could pin the Wi-Fi tasks to one core and sensor tasks to another if needed. The esp-idf-svc likely defaults to running things on core 0 for system, leaving core 1 for your app tasks. You can also adjust the core affinity of threads in FreeRTOS if needed. But unless performance issues arise, it’s not necessary.
-   Watchdog: The IDF has a watchdog timer on both CPUs that will reset if tasks don’t yield in a certain time. If you have a long-running loop (like processing something heavy in a tight loop), make sure to occasionally sleep or yield to avoid watchdog resets. For instance, if doing intense computation on audio in the main thread, call std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10)) occasionally or split work across frames. Or disable the watchdog in menuconfig (not recommended for production). The Ferrous course hint mentions using sleep in loops to yield .

  

  

  

8.3 Project Structure and Next Steps

  

  

Bringing it all together, a possible structure in main() for the final integrated system might look like:

  

1.  Initialize logging.
2.  Initialize Wi-Fi and connect (perhaps spawn a thread to manage network).
3.  Initialize camera (one-time setup).
4.  Initialize BLE (if direct glasses comm used).
5.  Loop:  
    

-   Capture audio until silence or for a fixed duration triggered by a button/voice command.
-   Spawn a thread to send audio to transcription API (so main loop can maybe prepare next capture or blink LED).
-   Get transcription result; if using AugmentOS cloud directly, that request itself might yield final result.
-   If not, send transcription to AI API and get result.
-   Send/display result via chosen method (AugmentOS or BLE).
-   Repeat or wait for next trigger.

7.    
    

  

  

You might also incorporate a push-button or some trigger to start the capture, to avoid capturing everything continuously. XIAO has a boot button we could repurpose (the boot button tied to GPIO0 typically).

  

Diagrams: It’s often helpful to draw a flow diagram or state diagram of the system (e.g., Idle -> Recording -> Transcribing (cloud) -> Speaking (glasses) -> back to Idle). We can’t literally draw here, but you could sketch one on paper as you design.

  

Further Resources: To deepen your Rust embedded knowledge, check out:

  

-   The Embedded Rust Book (official guide) and Rust on ESP Book .
-   The rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust list for crates and examples (for instance, drivers for various sensors, or no_std patterns).
-   Espressif’s forums and GitHub for latest on Rust support (it’s evolving; by the time you read this, things might have improved or changed versions). Keep an eye on the esp-rs repo for updates.
-   Ferrous Systems’ training materials (we quoted some here ) for deeper dives especially on writing drivers, interrupts, etc.

  

  

Finally, don’t forget to have fun and experiment. Embedded Rust has a learning curve, but you’ve now seen how powerful it can be – safe concurrency, rich library support, and the ability to orchestrate complex tasks on a tiny device. Happy hacking!
