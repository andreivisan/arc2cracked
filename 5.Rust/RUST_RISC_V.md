# Build RISC-V

## Logic gates

- In digital circuits wires stabilise to one of the two voltages: a high voltage (VDD)
or a low voltage (VSS or ground). So, a wire(bit) carries a boolean value, where high and low
voltages can be viewed as 1/0, true/false, asserted/deasserted, on/off, etc.

> - The small circle on the output of a gate indicates an inverted output.
> - XOR and XNOR are "exclusive" OR and NOR, where "exclusive" means "but not both".

## Aritmetic Logic

- While individual wires (or "bits") hold one of two values in a digital circuit, we can
have a collection of N wires (called a "vector") that represent up to 2^N possible values.
