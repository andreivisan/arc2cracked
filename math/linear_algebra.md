## Vectors

### Definition and Notation

- A vector is an ordered collection of numbers (called components or elements), which we often represent in a column form.

$\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}$

- In finance, you might have a vector of asset returns, e.g., $\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n)^\top$

### Basic Operations

1. Vector Addition

$\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 
u_1 + v_1 \\ 
u_2 + v_2 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
u_n + v_n 
\end{pmatrix}$
