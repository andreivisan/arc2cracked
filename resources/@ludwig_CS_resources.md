Tips
----

*   Do the exercises! Don't just read.
*   Learning to code is done by coding. Build terminal applications, build simple HTTP servers, build tools you might want to use. Nothing is too complicated.
*   Study the fundamentals. Data structures, algorithms. Networking. How does memory work? What happens when you type google.com in your search bar?
*   Look underneath software you use. A lot of software is open-source. Consume a lot of code. Be curious.
*   If you have a specific career path and/or just want to enter the job market -- you can DM or @ me on X.
