# DSA + Java Mastery

## Weekly Overview

### Week 1 — Java Fundamentals Refresh + Foundation Data Structures

**Focus:**

1. **Java Refresher:** Quick review of essential features from Java 7 up to Java 11 (lambdas, streams, functional interfaces, new concurrency improvements, diamond operator, try-with-resources, etc.).
2. **Basic Data Structures:** Arrays (dynamic resizing), Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Deques.
3. **Coding from Scratch:** Implement each data structure in Java, focusing on correctness, performance, and a simple concurrency approach only if it’s obviously beneficial (e.g., a thread-safe queue).

### Week 2 — Java Concurrency Core + Heaps & Priority Queues

**Focus:**

1. **Concurrency Fundamentals:** The Java Memory Model, synchronized, volatile, java.util.concurrent package.
2. **Advanced Data Structures:** Binary Heaps, Priority Queues, Mergeable Heaps (optional).
3. **Thread-Safe Implementations:** Creating lock-based or lock-free versions of some of the data structures where it clearly matters (like a concurrent priority queue).

### Week 3 — Trees (BST, AVL, Red-Black) + Java 21/23 Features (Intro)

**Focus:**

1. **Tree Fundamentals:**
    - Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Balanced BSTs (AVL, Red-Black Trees).
    - Implementation from scratch: insertion, deletion, rotations, balancing.
2. **Java 21/23 Intro:**
    - Virtual threads (Project Loom) overview.
    - Pattern matching enhancements, switch expressions, records (from Java 16 onward), sealed classes (Java 17), etc.
    - Structured concurrency concepts (if you want a small preview).

### Week 4 — Advanced Trees, Tries & Intro to GPU (OpenCL) Setup

**Focus:**

1. **Advanced Trees:** B-Trees, B+Trees (for databases), Tries (prefix trees), Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees).
2. **OpenCL Basics:**
    - Setting up a minimal OpenCL environment on your M2 Max.
    - Understanding data transfer between CPU and GPU, kernel execution concepts, and how it might apply to data structures or certain algorithms (e.g., large scale array manipulations).

### Week 5 — Graph Data Structures + GPU Explorations

**Focus:**

1. **Graph Implementations:** Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Weighted/Unweighted representations.
2. **Basic Graph Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Shortest Path (Dijkstra), Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal/Prim).
3. **Concurrency & GPU:**
    - Possibly parallelize BFS/DFS or short path computations.
    - Evaluate if it’s feasible/practical to accelerate these with OpenCL on your M2 Max.

### Week 6 — Sorting & Searching Algorithms + Concurrency/Parallelism

**Focus:**

1. **Sorting:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort (if time permits).
2. **Searching:** Binary Search, Interpolation Search, other specialized searching methods.
3. **Parallel/Concurrent Versions:**
    - Parallel mergesort or quicksort using the ForkJoinPool or Java 21 structured concurrency.
    - Possibly exploring GPU-accelerated sorting (e.g., bitonic sort on GPU) if you’re interested in that path.

### Week 7 — Advanced Algorithms (DP, String Processing, Suffix Arrays) + Deeper Java 21/23

**Focus:**

1. **Dynamic Programming:** Classic examples (Knuth, Floyd-Warshall, DP on trees, etc.).
2. **String Algorithms:** Suffix arrays, suffix trees, KMP pattern matching, Rabin-Karp.
2. **Java 21/23 Deeper Dive:**
    - More advanced concurrency constructs (structured concurrency, virtual threads in real scenarios).
    - Pattern matching refinements, record patterns, sealed classes usage in real data-structure scenarios.

### Week 8 — Final Consolidation, Review, and God-Mode “Proof” Projects

**Focus:**

1. **Project(s) to Show Off Skills:**
    - A choose-your-own “capstone” project that integrates multiple data structures/algorithms. Possibly a mini database engine, a concurrency-based real-time aggregator, or a GPU-accelerated search engine.
    - A combination of concurrency + GPU + advanced Java features.
2. **Final Review:**
    - Summarize what you’ve built and learned.
    - Revisit any topics that need more in-depth coverage (e.g., partial re-implementation of your trickiest data structures with concurrency).
3. **Practice:**
    - Short timed coding tests for typical “DS/Algo” interview questions, with your newly learned concurrency and GPU twist.
