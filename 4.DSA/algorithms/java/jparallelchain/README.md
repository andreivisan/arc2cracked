# JPU

A Java library focused on implementing all the Data Structures needed to perform LeetCode problems, with increased speed achieved 
by running essential operations on the GPU.

## Data Structures

1. **Dynamic Array**
2. **Linked List**
3. **Stack**
4. **Queue**
5. **Dequeue**
6. **HashTable / HashMap / HashSet**
7. **Tree Structures**
    - **Binary Tree**
    - **Binary Search Tree**
    - **Self Balancing BTSs**: AVL, Red-Black
8. **Heap / Priority Queue**
9. **Grap Structures**
    - Adjacency List: Ideal for sparse graphs.
    - Adjacency Matrix: Useful for dense graphs or when constant time edge existence queries are needed.
    - Edge List: Sometimes used for algorithms that process edges directly.
        â€“ GPU Opportunities: Parallel graph processing (like BFS/DFS or centrality computations) can leverage GPU capabilities.
10. **Trie**
11. **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**
12. **Segment Tree**
13. **Fenwick Tree**
14. **Skip List**
